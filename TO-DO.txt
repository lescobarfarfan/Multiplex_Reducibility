1) Check if the implementation of the Laplacian for directed-weighted graphs gives good results
2) Check stopping conditions for the greedy algorithm, specifically, check that the implemented
conditions are consistent with the methodology presented in the paper.
3) Check why the degree and the number of active layers are identical for the undirected-unweighted and
the directed-weighted multilayers.
