1) Check if the implementation of the Laplacian for directed-weighted graphs gives good results,
and if having a negative value to calculate the  distance makes sense in this setting.

2) Check stopping conditions for the greedy algorithm, specifically, check that the implemented
conditions are consistent with the methodology presented  in the paper.


3) Check why the degree and the number of active layers are identical for the undirected-unweighted and
the directed-weighted multilayers. (DONE, they are different, implementing error)

4) Add new conditions on the final selection of the optimal aggregation, specifically, a lot
of "optimal" aggregations turn out to be the total combined network (causing funky business in
the calculation of the systemic risk per layer)

5) Make a better implementation of debtrank, results differ highly from the ones on the paper.
